# Moving-Non-Divergent-Barotropic-Vorticity 

#### Using the poisson equation, we use already created vorticity data and poisson solver module 

#### In this project, we use three different files for forecasting from 2-9, 10-99, 100-999 hours respectively named t2-10, t11-100, t101-1000 because of coding ease.

#### Output figures are in L9fig folder, We can observe that the vorticity is moving left.
