# Moving-Non-Divergent-Barotropic-Vorticity 

#### This project aimed at producing moving non-divergent barotropic vorticity.

#### Using the poisson equation, we use already created vorticity data using successive relaxation algorithm and poisson solver module. 

#### In this project, we use three different files for forecasting from 2-9, 10-99, 100-999 hours respectively named t2-10, t11-100, t101-1000 because of coding ease.

#### Output figures are in L9fig folder, We can observe that the vorticity is moving left.

#### Mathematical basics for algorithm are here https://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Barotropic_model and https://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Poisson_equation.
